> This application was developed as a tool that allows for the examination of changes in FDA compliance check inspections over time. The tool is integrated with Truth Initiative’s GIS portal, which allows users to explore how compliance check inspections may be associated with a range of other factors. Users can quickly zoom to their local area and bookmark their preferences as they overlay various data sources and visualize the results.
